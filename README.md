# origin-starter-kit

I plan on making a more in depth read me that will better explain how to put together origins for yourself, but right now this is all I can get myself to write.

The "data" and "extradata" folders contain all the .JSON folders from the original Origins and Extra Origins mods which can be downloaded here:
Origins: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins
Extra Origins: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-origins
